# Bau Cua Tom Ca
## Introduction
Welcome to my Bau Cua Tom Ca game, this is a popular game to play during Tet, vietnamese holidy. The game is quite simple as you are betting on six different figures on the board and may the god of luck bless you with his blessing.
## Gameplay:
### Scene 1 (mini_game): The game started with you choosing your angpow from your relatives
There will be 10 angpow (red envelopes): You will be able to pick 5 of them. The amount of money on those are randomize from nothing to $100.

During game play, if you ever hit jackpot (3 dices turn out to be the same figures), then you will have a chance to go to mini_game scene which is the scene 1 to pick a random 5 angpow to add more (or nothing) to your current cash.
